Grade Completion portal extention:

Students should be able to devise a student portal that connects the student who wants to undergo the grade completion process with the dean and concerned faculty. A portal that gives the student the choice of whether to undergo completion or not and if they choose to undergo that process, the dean of their respective college is notifed of this application for approval and e-signature which in turn notifies the concerned faculty to begin the process. The faculty then uploads the grade during the prescribed period. The portal is open for the duration of the completion period and is locked afterwards.


Incomplete:
1. e-signature; upload e-signature
2. Faculty dashboard - approved grade does not show completion request
3. Submission deadline - confused on how to apply it, Dean or Faculty? 
4. Student Dashboard - fake users debugging
